Most clothing/footwear brands are divided by Men’s/Women’s at a top level. “Modern” brands often make a primarily unisex collection to cut costs, but do photoshoots with models of various genders to appeal these products to different audiences.

Personally, I shop all sections and ignore gender labels, which are designed to funnel people into [[Stereotype]]s.
