The process of actively selecting material goods and nonmaterial vibes (aesthetics, ) that form, augment, and accent your own identities.

I take the process of curation hyper-seriously: exploring cities, I’m on a unending prowl to find all the Good Spots, look through their offerings, and curate for myself the best items. It’s a process of constantly making and refining my taste, filtering stimulation through it to see what sticks with and on me.
