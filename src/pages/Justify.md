My primary challenge when contemplating any new consumption: can I justify it?

Justification can be an immediate need—I need lunch—or an abstract reason for a nebulous desire—I like this, and I’m under budget this month. After deciding I like something, my mind is consumed in trying to justify the purchase; I try to avoid [[XS]], and the line between consumption and overconsumption changes constantly according to my income, recent spending, location, the rarity of the item, and my current mood.
