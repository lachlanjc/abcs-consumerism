Instagram [[Advertising]] constantly feels oriented toward my becoming a stereotypical version of myself; in my case, though I want none of these things, Instagram wants me to be a more sexually available twink with more partners, taking more supplements, using more grooming products, spending more energy on physical fitness, spending more money in [[New York]] on more things to put on Instagram. These ads are oriented around me becoming a more generic, more defined type of person who is more easily advertised to. Itâ€™s about making my identity more typed, more consumable, and one that requires constant consumption to maintain.
