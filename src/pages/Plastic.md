Everywhere I look, the answer to how anything is made or how any physical property exists or why a price tag is what it is usually comes back to plastic. Plastic is a testament to the incredible ingenuity of humans with materials and tools: one we fully invented and found a use for in every last thing. It’s poisoning us and the environment, but it’s making a bunch of companies rich by allowing us to consume ever-more for ever-less money. It’s both a magic material we should keep using in plenty of contexts, and one we need to ardently rid of many others. As we phase out fossil fuels, it’s how the same extractive energy companies will find new relevance and greater scale this century: finding ways to embed [[Petroleum]]-based chemicals and plastics in an infinity of supply chains that don’t even yet exist.
