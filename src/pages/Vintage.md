A synonym for thrifting/buying anything second-hand, no matter its age; a process of [[Curation]].

(I often run into “H&M from a few months ago” at “vintage” stores, and many of these stores, like Buffalo Exchange, tuck in new items to diversify their revenue streams.)

After purchasing, vintage often allows you to wear [[Unobtainium]]: when someone asks where you got an intriguing garment, “I thrifted it” gives an effortless “you’ll never have it” you can offer with an aspirational location of where you bought it. Vintage shopping motivates my trips to certain neighborhoods, like Brick Lane in London or Neukölln in Berlin, where I can find more exotic items than I find at home.
