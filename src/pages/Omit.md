Brands love to leave a lot omitted: most typically, summarizing material content in one word and leaving the details of the production to “Made in China.” You cannot know where exactly anything was made, when, by who, how, under what conditions, with what consequences. By omitting all these details, all the focus can be on the designed/branded sides of the experience, that corporate controls, and leave no inroads to discovering anything about the brand that isn’t controlled. This omission is key to maintaining the [[Illusion]].
