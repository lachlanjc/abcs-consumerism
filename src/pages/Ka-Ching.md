The sound of Apple Pay after I tap my watch/iPhone on a payment terminal.

Itâ€™s a sound I find lovely, exciting, and associate with paying my favorite way at my favorite places. Apple made the checkout process far easier, removing friction to allow transaction volume to increase, assuring me of the privacy/security benefits, while inserting themselves into the process, taking a small cut from every purchase forever. Ka-Ching! The sound of an absolutely brilliant product strategy.
